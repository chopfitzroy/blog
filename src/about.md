Heya, 👋

Formerly Technical Lead at [Fingermark](https://www.fingermark.tech/), now Senior Developer at [Cucumber](https://www.cucumber.co.nz/).

I am an open source enthusiast, despite the fact that I need to contribute more 🤖.

I like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) 💚, [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) 🔗, and I am currently obsessed with [xState](https://xstate.js.org/) 💙, I also spend a lot of time with [React](https://reactjs.org/) ⚛ and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) 🎓 at work.

I am interested in fishing 🎣, reading 📚, hiking 🗻, and gaming 🎮.

If you have any questions or want to get in touch please use the email address listed in my [GitHub bio](https://github.com/chopfitzroy).
