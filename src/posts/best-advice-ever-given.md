### Introduction üöÄ

Giving feedback can be an incredibly delicate process, it can help individuals improve, but it can also damage their confidence if delivered poorly. Personally I struggle to recieve feedback about myself and it has been a long and difficult journey learning how to seperate my personal feelings from my professional progress. That being said almost every piece of feedback I have every recieved has improved my ability both professionally and personally. üíô

### What makes good feedback? ü§î

There are many different kinds of feedback, and some is definitely more impactful than others. So what makes good feedback? here are some examples of what I think make good feedback.

**Be sure to highlight to positives**; ideally whenever you have to give difficult feedback it helps to also have prepared positive feedback to help whoever is recieving feedback feel like they are not failing across the board.

**Personal but not critical**; everyone needs to hear how they can improve, but they are far less likely to take it on board if they feel like they are being attacked. Avoid negative connotations, instead of telling someone what they have produced is wrong, tell them what additional work would be required to make it right.

**Highlight the impact**; often people struggle to understand why they are recieving feedback if you don't highlight why. There is no point in telling someone that it's important notify you of delays in an client project if you can't demonstrate the impact. Instead say "our client was confused when we couldn't go live with their website on schedule, if I had known earlier about any issues I could have prepared the client for any delays".

**Give feedback fast and often**; don't wait until there is too much feedback to give that you require one hour in a meeting room. Nothing makes difficult feedback worse than feeling like it has to be scheduled. Address situations as they arise and preferably in an informal environment. If there is a lot to say invite your colleague out for a coffee and help them to feel comfortable being open. And always give positive feedback when you can, regular positive feedback helps to offset difficult feedback when it is required.

### Why do we need to be careful when giving feedback? üíä

Everyone handles feedback differently and some individuals take it far more personally than others.
<!-- Write about fear of rejection -->
<!-- Write about feeling isolated or "put on the spot" -->

### How to create a feedback friendly environemnt üå¥

<!-- Write about making sure everyone gives feedback -->
<!-- Write about making sure your team gives you feedback -->
<!-- Write about framing feedback as a positive process and not a criticism -->

### What was the best feedback I was ever given? üî•

Interestingly the best feedback I have ever recieved was not related to software development at all. During the earlier stages of my career I was fortunate enough to work along side a systems engineer who was incredibly successful both in his chosen career, as well as a number of personal business endeavours. This particular colleague was a wealth of information and had a particular way of taking in the world that was truly fascinating to watch. ü§Ø

During my time there I was contacted by a friend form my high school years with a potential employment oppurtunity, I was close enough to my colleague to disclose the information to them and let them know that I wasn't interested in pursuing this particular oppurtunity at this time. My colleague then looked me dead in the eyes and said "you should always hear out an oppurtunity when given the chance, no matter how much you think you may not be interested". As I said this colleague had been incredibly successful outside of his chosen career and I decided it was probably best to listen to his feedback. With this in mind I contacted my childhood friend an arranged an interview. ü§ì

To cut a long story short I was presented with a job offer but it would have required relocation, at the time I was not interested in moving so I passed on the offer and let my friend know to stay in touch. One month later I ended up moving anyway to be with my now fianc√© and took the first local oppurtunity I could find with a considerably lower salary that I was used to. One month into the new position my friend got back in touch letting me know the company had huge success hiring remote engineers and wanted to know if I would be interested in remote work. I jumped at the chance, the work was exciting and the pay was fantastic! I handed in my notice the next day. The company I was with counter offered aggresively and negotiations began. In the end I opted to remain with the current company but was able to maintain a good working relationship with my friend and maintain regular contact. ü•≥

So what is the point of that story? ü•± By hearing out an opportunity I was not interested in and ultimately turned down, I was able to nearly double my salary four months later. What I took away from this experience was that even the opportunities that you don't necessarily act on immediately can provide huge value later on. And really what cost is there to hearing someone out? ü§ó

### Wrapping up üéÅ

I know, I know, another no code article? I am hoping to dive into a few more technical topics soon but am struggling to find the time. There are definitely some surprises I am working on in the background to improve the blog so hopefully I will have some news on those soon. As always if you have any questions or want to know more feel free to reach out to me via email (found on my [Github](https://github.com/chopfitzroy)) and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
