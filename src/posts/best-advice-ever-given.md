### Introduction üöÄ

Giving feedback can be an incredibly delicate process, it can help individuals improve, but it can also damage their confidence if delivered poorly. Personally I struggle to recieve feedback about myself and it has been a long and difficult journey learning how to seperate my personal feelings from my professional progress. That being said almost every piece of feedback I have every recieved has improved my ability both professionally and personally. üíô

### What makes good feedback? ü§î

There are many different kinds of feedback, and some are definitely more impactful than others. So what makes good feedback? here are some examples of what I think make good feedback.

**Be sure to highlight to positives**; ideally whenever you have to give difficult feedback it helps to also have prepared positive feedback to help whoever is recieving feedback feel like they are not failing across the board.

**Personal but not critical**; everyone needs to hear how they can improve, but they are far less likely to take it on board if they feel like they are being attacked. Avoid negative connotations. Instead of telling someone what they have produced is wrong, tell them what additional work would be required to make it right.

**Highlight the impact**; often people struggle to understand why they are recieving feedback if you don't highlight why. There is no point in telling someone that it's important notify you of delays in a client project if you can't demonstrate the impact. Instead say "our client was confused when we couldn't go live with their website on schedule, if I had known earlier about any issues I could have prepared the client for any delays".

**Give feedback fast and often**; don't wait until there is too much feedback to give that you require one hour in a meeting room to do it. Nothing makes difficult feedback worse than feeling like it has to be scheduled. Address situations as they arise and preferably in an informal environment. If there is a lot to say invite your colleague out for a coffee and help them to feel comfortable. And always give positive feedback when you can, regular positive feedback helps to offset difficult feedback when it is required.

### Why do we need to be careful when giving feedback? üíä

Everyone handles feedback differently and some individuals take it far more personally than others. I myself have a _fear of rejection_ and this can largely impact how I interpret feedback when it is given to me. Over the years I have realized that the best way to manage this is to step away when I am feeling hurt and give myself time to process whatever feedback has been given. No two people handle feedback in the same way and it is really important to understand your audience before giving them any feedback. I like to handle this by establishing an open narrative with my team and ask them up front how they like to recieve feedback. Some like to recieve feedback face to face, while others prefer an email, followed by a face to face session once they are ready. By optimizing the environment for giving feedback you not only help the individual recieving the feedback to feel comfortable you also significantly increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. üíö

However you choose to give members of your team feedback make sure you avoid ever putting them on the spot. This often only happens in high stress situations or where external pressure is being felt but it is absolutely imperative that you do not let this overrule whatever frameworks for feedback you have put in place. An example of this might be when a project is running over and you are feeling pressure from a client. Instead of sending your normal pre-empative feedback email to a team member you address them directly in front of their peers and let them know that they need to improve their ability to estimate ticket times. This kind of feedback might feel impactful intially, especially if said team member is affraid of failure, however this kind of approach eventually leads to dissatisfaction amoung team members and sometimes even ill will. üòñ

### How to create a feedback friendly environemnt üå¥

One of the things that makes feedback such a sensitive topic is the fact that it is often only given when improvement is required. To create an environment where feedback is recieved more readily make sure that all kinds of feedback are given both positive and difficult. Additionally try to make feedback regular and fleeting. Instead of providing a few comments and the end of the month try to provide at least one comment a day, ideally more. It is worth noting that while people are _often_ less opposed to being given postive feedback on the spot it pays check with them, some people dislike any kind of call-out even a positive one. üí™

Try to have as many as three positive comments for every difficult one. If this seems impossible look to the enviroment your team is working in and ask yourself if it is really optimized for their success? In my experience if positive feedback is scarce it usually means that your team is not in an environment where they are able to thrive. Try to indentify what is blocking them and resolve it as quickly as possible. üå¥

Make sure your team is giving you feedback. This one might seem obvious but a lot of people are afraid to give feedback to their immediate managers/team leads/etc... Regularily encourage your team to give feedback to yourself, and their peers. If you are recieving no feedback about yourself it is less likely that you are doing a great job and more likely that your team are afraid of how you might react. Remember feedback feels a lot less personal if the person you are recieving it from is also the person you are giving it to. üôè

### What was the best feedback I was ever given? üî•

Interestingly the best feedback I have ever recieved was not related to software development at all. It is worth noting that is section could have probably been called "What was the best advice I was ever given?". However I do consider this feedback as it was given in response to a particular behavior I demonstrated regularily.

During the earlier stages of my career I was fortunate enough to work along side a systems engineer who was incredibly successful both in his chosen career, as well as a number of personal business endeavours. This particular colleague was a wealth of information and had a particular way of taking in the world that was truly fascinating to watch. ü§Ø

During my time working with this systems engineer I was contacted by a friend frmm my high school years with a potential employment oppurtunity. I was close enough to my colleague to disclose the information to them and let them know that I wasn't interested in pursuing this particular oppurtunity at this time. My colleague then looked me dead in the eye and said "you should always hear out an oppurtunity when given the chance, no matter how much you think you may not be interested". As I said this colleague had been incredibly successful outside of their chosen career and I decided it was probably best to listen to their feedback. With this in mind I contacted my childhood friend an arranged an interview. ü§ì

To cut a long story short I was presented with a job offer but it would have required relocation, at the time I was not interested in moving so I passed on the offer and let my friend know to stay in touch. One month later I ended up moving anyway to be with my now fianc√© and took the first local oppurtunity I could find with a considerably lower salary than I was used to. One month into the new position my friend got back in touch letting me know the company had huge success hiring remote engineers and wanted to know if I would be interested in remote work. I jumped at the chance, the work was exciting and the pay was fantastic! I handed in my notice the next day. The company I was with counter offered aggresively and negotiations began. In the end I opted to remain with the current company but was able to maintain a good working relationship with my friend and maintain regular contact. ü•≥

So what is the point of that story? ü•± By hearing out an opportunity I was not interested in and ultimately turned down, I was able to nearly double my salary four months later. What I took away from this experience was that even the opportunities that you don't necessarily act on immediately can provide huge value later on. And really what is the cost of hearing someone out? ü§ó

### Wrapping up üéÅ

I know, I know, another no code article? I am hoping to dive into a few more technical topics soon but am struggling to find the time. There are definitely some surprises I am working on in the background to improve the blog so hopefully I will have some news on those soon. As always if you have any questions or want to know more feel free to reach out to me via email (found on my [Github](https://github.com/chopfitzroy)) and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
