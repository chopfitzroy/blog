### Introduction 🚀

Picture this, you are in a meeting everyone is talking over each other, no one really seems to know what is going on. But one thing is clear, your team is about to take on a challenge so unique no one could have possibly ever handled anything like this before 🤯! Sound familiar? I don't know about you but I cannot count the number of times I have started a new project and within the first few hours the team will be talking about developing new architectural patterns to solve a problem far to unique for conventional methods.

Now don't get me wrong there absolutely are people solving problems that do exist outside the realm of normal software methodologies, but there is a really good chance that whatever problems you are trying to solve at your day to day job are not so unique that they require reinventing the wheel 🎓. I am not sure where this issue comes from, originally I thought it was related to ego and perhaps only occured when working with developers early on in their career, but I have experienced this from all developers including those much more seasoned than myself 🤔.

### Why this is problematic? 💢

<!-- Write about how custom solutions don't often scale, are hard to on board for, are difficult to pivot from -->

### Why does this happen? 💭

<!-- Write about how this is often an overreaction to problems that have occured in previous projects -->
<!-- Write about how developers often want to try the latest and greatest -->

### Taking a step back 😎

<!-- Write about how if you feel like you need a custom solution, there is a good chance you are approaching the problem wrong -->

### Pick the right tools 🔨

<!-- Write about how people often choose from different brands of hammers when often they need a screw driver -->

### Don't be dogmatic 🐶

<!-- Write about how you can break out to something custom in certain scenarios -->

### Wrapping up 🎁
