### Introduction 🚀

Most developers don't like working with other peoples code, but sometimes they even don't like working with their own code! Now I want to make it clear that this is not a bad thing, struggling to reason about code you wrote one year ago, one month ago, or even one week ago often means you have improved as a developer and techniques you thought were effecient then now seem dated compared to the current tools in your belt 🔨.

That being said it is inevitable that you are going to have to revisit existing code from time to time, sometimes it will be yours, sometimes it will be someone else's entirely. Knowing this it can pay to set your future self up for success today so you don't end up cursing past you tomorrow 🤬.
